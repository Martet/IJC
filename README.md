# Project 1
## Task
1. Create a bitfield data structure with operations for creating, freeing, setting and getting individual bits. These operations should be inplemented as macros or inline functions, depending on conditional compilation.
Use the implmented bitfield to get the 10 largest prime numbers under 200000000 with the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
2. Write a program that decodes data hidden in the least significant bits of bytes on indexes that are prime numbers starting with 23 in a .ppm image.

# Project 2
## Task
1. Write a program tail.c that works the same as an UNIX tail (outputs the last n lines or all lines after +n).
2. Rewrite `wordcount.cc` into c, create a hash table structure with all operations as defined in `htab.h`.
